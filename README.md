# GPU-PIM simulator

This is a fork from the original gem5 to create a GPU hosted PIM simulator combining
AMD gpu models with Aquabolt PIM simulator.

# The gem5 Simulator

This is the repository for the gem5 simulator. It contains the full source code
for the simulator and all tests and regressions.

The gem5 simulator is a modular platform for computer-system architecture
research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor
microarchitecture. It is primarily used to evaluate new hardware designs,
system software changes, and compile-time and run-time system optimizations.

The main website can be found at <http://www.gem5.org>.

## Building gem5

Once you have all dependencies resolved, execute
`scons build/ALL/gem5.opt` to build an optimized version of the gem5 binary
(`gem5.opt`) containing all gem5 ISAs. If you only wish to compile gem5 to
include a single ISA, you can replace `ALL` with the name of the ISA. Valid
options include `ARM`, `NULL`, `MIPS`, `POWER`, `RISCV`, `SPARC`, and `X86`
The complete list of options can be found in the build_opts directory.
